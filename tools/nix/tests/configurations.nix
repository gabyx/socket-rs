  # Glossary:
  # LAN: Local Area Network  -- private address space, behind a NAT.
  # WAN: Wide Area Network   -- the "public" side, past the NAT.
  # Frame: One Ethernet packet as it goes over the wire: destination MAC, source MAC, a type field, the payload (your IP packet). Bytes on a cable.
  # Layer 2: The Ethernet layer (OSI Stack), where MAC addresses live. Layer 3 is IP. A switch works at layer 2; a router works at layer 3.
  # Segment (or broadcast domain): One set of machines that can hear each other's frames directly, without a router.
  # Tag: In a real 802.1Q VLAN, 4 extra bytes inserted into the frame header carrying a VLAN id.
  #      It lets one physical cable carry several segments, kept apart by that number.

  # Each number below is one separate virtual network. The NixOS test driver
  # starts a `vde_switch` process (Virtual Distributed Ethernet -- a userspace
  # Ethernet switch) per number, and a VM's interface plugs into exactly one of
  # them. Despite the option being called `vlan`, no IEEE 802.1Q tag is
  # involved: these are simply three unconnected networks, not one wire carrying
  # three tagged streams.
  #
  # Consequence: a node on vlan 1 cannot reach a node on vlan 3 at all. The only
  # path between them is a node with an interface on both, which forwards
  # packets. That node is the NAT router -- so every packet between side-a and
  # the WAN must pass through nat-a, by construction.
